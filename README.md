# Smurf Invaders

Smurf Invaders. Technical Demo as an explorative project of Raylib. Random game based on Space Invaders and alike.

## Why

I've stumbled upon [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) some days ago, and it looked amazing. Easy to use, and very powerful.
So, now in lockdown, I started developing this game as a simple demo to explore the capabilities of the library.

This is a work in progress, without any clear definite route whatsoever. 
However, I'm trying to do most of the progress on streaming, so check out my [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/thepitulegend) if you're interested (I'll stream in spanish tho, unless many english-speaking users enter the stream at some point).

## What's done right now

* Basic 3D static scenario
* Player model and movement
* Shootable and functional bullets
* Enemy pooling (same system as the bullets, probably)
* Static enemies

## TODO list

* Serious performance issues with bullet/enemy collision. #1 priority.
* Enemy behaviour
* Damageable player
* HUD (Life + Score. I'll decide later how life managing will work)
* Dynamic scenario
* Music
* Sound effects
